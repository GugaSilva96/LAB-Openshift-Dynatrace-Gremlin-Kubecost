## The Gremlin Configuration File
##
## Populating the values below is the preferred way to configure Gremlin installations directly on the host.
## This file is read by both `gremlin` and `gremlind` processes without having to export shell environment variables.
##
## More info at https://www.gremlin.com/docs/infrastructure-layer/advanced-configuration/
##
## Uncomment and edit the lines below to pass them to Gremlin.
## NOTE: a restart of `gremlind` is necessary to pick up changes
